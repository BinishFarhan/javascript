// data types variables and operations.
// by sir saad class 16  

//prompt except only string data type to convert it's data type add + sign before prompt.

//when we set var with name abc next time to add any thing in its value we dont need to type var again.

// for ex
// var num = 5
// num = num + 5

//JS is interpreter read code line by line left to right

// var number1 = 10

// number1++   // (post increament) add 1 no. in next time
// ++number1    (pre increament) add 1 no. at a time

// number--   ( post decreament) deduct 1 no. in next time
// --number   (pre deccreament)  deduct 1 no. at a time

// any value or code with () is called function.

// when except + or - multiple arithematic operations are used it will solve as BODMAS. with only + or - JS read the code from left to right.
//for ex:
// var y = 10
// var u = 5
// var w = 2
 // var res = y - w * u (y + w) + y   .... but here u with round bracket is coded as a manual funciton
 // var res = y - w *  (y + w) + y .. now when we removed u the round bracket will be with operator of * now. so it will use as a function . it will be simple ()
 

 //to check the data type in prompt 
//  document.write(typeof(w))
